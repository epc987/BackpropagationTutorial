    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "With the democratization of deep learning and the introduction of open source tools like Tensorflow or Keras, you can nowadays train [a convolutional neural network to classify images of dogs and cats with little knowledge about Python](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/5.2-using-convnets-with-small-datasets.ipynb\n",
    "). Unfortunately, these tools tend to abstract the hard part away from us, and we are then tempted to skip the understanding of the inner mechanics . In particular, not understanding backpropagation, the bread and butter of deep learning, would most probably lead you to badly design your networks. In a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b\n",
    "), Andrej Karpathy, now director of AI at Tesla, listed few reasons why you should understand backpropagation. Problems such as vanishing and exploding gradients, or dying relus are some of them. Backpropagation is not a very complicated algorithm, and with some knowledge about calculus especially the chain rules, it can be understood pretty quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, like any other supervised learning algorithms, learn to map an input to an output based on some provided examples of (input, output) pairs, called the training set. In particular, neural networks performs this mapping by processing the input through a set of transformations. A neural network is composed of several layers, and each of these layers are made of units (also called neurons) as illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/static/images/neural_network.png\" style=\"width: 700px;\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture above, the input is transformed first through the hidden layer 1, then the second one and finally an output is predicted. Each transformation is controlled by a set of weights (and biases). During training, to indeed learn something, the network needs to adjust these weights to minimize the error (also called the loss function) between the expected outputs and the ones it maps from the given inputs. Using [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) as an optimization algorithm, the weights are updated at each iteration as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w^{(n+1)} = w^{(n)} - \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} $, where L is the loss function and $\\epsilon$ is the learning rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "AAs we can see above, the gradient of the loss with respect to the weight is substracted from the weight at each iteration. This is the so called gradient descent. The gradient $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} $ can be interpreted as a measure of the contribution of the weight to the loss. Therefore the larger is this gradient (in absolute value), the more the weight is updated during an iteration of gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minimization of the loss function task ends up being related to the evaluation of the gradients described above. We will review 3 proposals to perform this evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analytical calculation of the gradients.\n",
    "* Approximation of the gradients as being: $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} = \\frac{L(w + \\delta w) - L(w)}{\\delta w}$, where $\\delta w \\rightarrow 0$.\n",
    "* Backpropagation or reverse mode autodiff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the details of these proposals, we will first clearly define our problem and simplify it for the sake of the discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify our discussion, we will consider that each layer of the network is made of a single unit, and that we have a single hidden layer. The network looks now like: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static/images/neural_network_1D.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss a little bit about how the input is transformed to produce the hidden layer representation. In neural network, a layer is obtained by performing two operations on the previous layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First the previous layer is tranformed via a linear operation: the value of the previous layer is multiplied by a weight, and a bias is added to it. It gives: \n",
    "$z = xw + b$, where x is the value of the previous layer unit, w and b are respectively the weight and the bias discussed above.\n",
    "* Second, the previous linear operation is used as an input to the activation function of the unit. This activation is generally chosen to introduce non linearity in order to solve complex tasks. Here we will simply consider that this activation function is a sigmoid function: $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-x)}$. As a consequence the value y of a layer can be written as: \n",
    "$ y = \\sigma (z) = \\sigma (xw + b)$, with x, w and b defined as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, considering our case, with an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer, all made of a single unit and respectively called x, h and y, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h = \\sigma (xw_1 + b_1) $, where $w_1$ and $b_1$ are respectively the weight and the bias used to compute the hidden unit from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = \\sigma (hw_2 + b_2) $, where $w_2$ and $b_2$ are respectively the weight and the bias used to compute the output from the hidden unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we are able to calculate the output y based on the input x, through a set of transformations. This is the so called forward propagation since this calculation goes forward inside the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to compare this predicted ouptut to the true one $y_T$. As explained earlier, we use a loss function to quantify the error that the network does while prediciting. Here we will consider as a loss function the squared error defined as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$ L = \\frac{1}{2} (y-y_T)^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, the weights (and biases) need to be updated according to the gradient of this loss function L with respect to these weights (and biases). Therefore the challenge here is to evaluate these gradients. The first approach would be to manually derive them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical differentiation\n",
    "Although this method is cumbersome and error prone, it is worth to investigate to better understand the challenge Here we simplify a lot the problem since we have a single hidden layer and a single unit per layer. And yet the analytical derivation requires quite some attention.\n",

Although it comes out of the box with most of the deep learning frameworks, it is a good idea to get your hands dirty and understand a little bit more what it does. In some occasions, it might help you understand why your network is not learning properly."
